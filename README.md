# Twitter-sentiment-analysis-
This project involves developing a Twitter Sentiment Analysis tool using Tweepy, a Python library for accessing the Twitter API. The tool will allow users to pull tweets related to specific keywords, analyze the sentiment of the tweets (positive, negative, or neutral), and visualize the results. This project is ideal for understanding public opinion on various topics, tracking trends, or even monitoring brand sentiment over time.

Technologies Used:
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive development and visualization.
Tweepy: To interact with the Twitter API and pull tweets.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.
NLTK/VADER: For sentiment analysis (if not using a custom model).

Potential Applications:
Brand Monitoring: Track public sentiment around a brand or product.
Market Research: Understand public opinion on various topics or trends.
Political Analysis: Analyze sentiment related to political events or figures.
Customer Feedback: Collect and analyze feedback on services or products.

Expected Outcomes:
By the end of the project, you will have a fully functional tool capable of pulling tweets, analyzing sentiment, and visualizing the results. This tool can be further expanded to include more complex analysis, such as identifying key influencers or tracking sentiment across different regions.
